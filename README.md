## Mod Installer
This is a Next.js App which automatically installs fabric mods on your PC and creates a Minecraft Launcher Profile for you.

### Idea & Inspiration
This Project was highly inspired by the Innit.gg Installer made by [Cubxity](https://twitter.com/cubxity)  

### Features
- [x] Configure multiple profiles with different mods as admin
- [x] Install mods in new Launcher Profile (with different gameDir)
- [x] copy options.txt and servers.dat into new gameDir
- [x] Make server list of created profile configurable
- [x] Manual install
- [x] MultiMC Support
- [x] Configurable libraries / Minecraft Version (Currently only 1.18.2)
- [x] Configure and show incompatible mods
- [ ] Configure and show when a mod requires another mod
- [ ] Admin Panel
- [ ] User owned mod-lists (Thank you for the idea [Marie](https://github.com/NyCodeGHG))

I'm welcome to add stuff to this list (DM me on discord or create an issue)
